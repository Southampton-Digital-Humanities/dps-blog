Welcome to the newest blogging platform for [Digital Preservation Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/digital-preservation-southampton), an enterprise unit embedded within the Digital Humanities team at the University of Southampton. In this space, we will be posting blogs, testimonials, and thought pieces that reflect our work and our commitments to digital cultural heritage and the digital humanities. Furthermore, we will be documenting our partnerships with organisations, including lessons learned. We hope this provides an incentive for discussion and contributes to the dissemination of our work in the sector.

Enjoy the read!
